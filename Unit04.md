**Unit 4: Sampling and Sampling Distributions** <span id="4"></span> 
*While you may not become a professional data gatherer, it is likely
that you will need to compile data on a regular basis.  When gathering
data, you will not always have the luxury of collecting all available
data.  For example, economists cannot measure the entire unemployment of
the population, so they must take a random sample instead.  Likewise, in
a manufacturing facility, quality control managers do not have the
resources to test every product that comes off the line; it is simply
not feasible.  Instead, they take samples at various points during the
production process to test the quality of the products the firm
produces.*  
  
 *There are a number of methods employed in sampling data.  It is
important that the sampling method fits the application.  For example,
marketing managers may wish to test a product on various groups of
people.  They may define these groups by age, race, geography, income,
or any other factors.  They then divide the population into these groups
and take samples from each group in a process known as cluster
sampling.  If marketers do not properly divide the population, they may
end up marketing to the wrong demographic and achieving poor sales.*

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:  
-   differentiate the population from a sample;
-   define and apply simple random sampling;
-   identify and determine different types of selection bias and
    sampling errors, andexplain how to avoid these errors in survey
    sampling, such as selection and estimation errors, and apply these
    techniques;
-   describe and identify the different sampling methods, including
    systematic, stratified random, cluster, convenience, panel, and
    quota sampling, and identify an example of each; and
-   use a point estimator from a sample to estimate the entire
    population;

     Instructions: Read Chapter 24 for an explanation of what sampling
    means in statistics and its possible biases when collecting data for
    a sample. There are several exercises and Java applets embedded in
    the text that are meant to further reinforce your learning.  *Do not
    skip these exercises!*  For instructions on how to navigate these
    exercises, see “Special Instructions on *SticiGui* Exercises and
    Java Applets” in the “Course Information” section above. This
    resource covers the topics outlined in subunits 4.1.1 to 4.1.6.   
      
     Reading this chapter should take approximately 3 hours.

**4.1.1 Parameters and Statistics** <span id="4.1.1"></span> 
*Note: The reading and lectures assigned below subunit 4.1 cover this
topic. A parameter is a characteristic (such as the average) of a
population under interest, whereas a statistic is a characteristic of a
sample.*

**4.1.2 Why Sample?** <span id="4.1.2"></span> 
*Note: The reading and lectures assigned below subunit 4.1 cover this
topic. Taking a sample that is representative of a population under
interest is what the field of statistics is all about.  It is almost
impractical in real life to analyze all the observations belonging to a
population.*

**4.1.3 Sample Surveys** <span id="4.1.3"></span> 
*Note: The reading and lectures assigned below subunit 4.1 cover this
topic. Be aware that the rule in statistics is to take a sample that is
representative of the entire population, meaning that sampling bias
(such as taking a survey of only our friends in order to understand
consumer behavior) should be avoided.*

**4.1.4 Bias in Surveys** <span id="4.1.4"></span> 
*Note: The reading and lectures assigned below subunit 4.1 cover this
topic. Focus on how a researcher can introduce bias into a survey.*

**4.1.5 Sampling Designs** <span id="4.1.5"></span> 
*Note: The reading and lectures assigned below subunit 4.1 cover this
topic. Focus on the different ways to draw observations for a sample as
shown in the text under the section titled “Ways to Draw Samples.”*

**4.1.6 Sampling Distributions** <span id="4.1.6"></span> 
*Note: The reading and lectures assigned below subunit 4.1 cover this
topic. Be sure to view the Khan Academy’s video for this section as it
explains the meaning of distributions that apply to sample data.*
