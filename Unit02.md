**Unit 2: Counting, Probability, and Probability Distributions** <span
id="2"></span> 
*What is the likelihood that an event will occur?  What are the chances
that a given student will receive a 60-69 score?  By studying
distributions of data, you can determine the probability that a certain
event will occur.  By looking at the distribution of grades in a class,
you can identify the probability that a student will receive between a
60 and 69.  The applications of probability in business are infinite;
from predicting profits to determining the chances that a business model
will affect regulation, businesses use probability to make decisions
frequently.*  
    
 *Before you can focus on probability, you must first learn how to
count. What's that you say? You already know how to count? Maybe – but
in this unit you will learn techniques for counting the different ways
that multiple events can occur together. These are called*
“*Combinations*” *and* “*Permutations,*” *and they are a fundamental
concept needed to fully understand probability.*

matter.  Of importance is the formula for computing combinations, make
sure you know how to use it as explained in the text under the section
titled “Combinations (Unordered Choices).”*

**2.6.1 The Law of Large Numbers** <span id="2.6.1"></span> 
*Note: The reading and lecture assigned below subunit 2.6 cover this
topic. The Law of Large Numbers implies repeated sampling with
replacement, meaning that the events considered are assumed to be
independent from each other.*

**2.6.2 Expected Value of a Random Variable** <span id="2.6.2"></span> 
*Note: The reading and lecture assigned below subunit 2.6 cover this
topic. The expected value is another name for the “mean” (or average)
when outcomes have probabilities attached to them.  Make sure you know
how to compute the expected value as shown for the data from Table
21-1.*

**2.6.3 Expected Value of a Sample Sum** <span id="2.6.3"></span> 
*Note: The reading and lecture assigned below subunit 2.6 cover this
topic. Make sure you know how to apply the formula as given in the text
under the section titled “Expected Value of a Sample Sum.”*

**2.6.4 Properties of the Expected Value** <span id="2.6.4"></span> 
*Note: The reading and lecture assigned below subunit 2.6 cover this
topic. Make sure you know how to apply the formulas as given in the text
under the section titled “Properties of the Expected Value.”*

**2.6.5 Expected Value of the Sample Mean and Sample Percentage** <span
id="2.6.5"></span> 
*Note: The reading and lecture assigned below subunit 2.6 cover this
topic. Make sure you know how to apply the formulas as given in the text
under the section titled “Expected Value of the Sample Mean and Sample
Percentage.”*

**2.6.6 Gambling and Fair Bets** <span id="2.6.6"></span> 
*Note: The reading and lecture assigned below subunit 2.6 cover this
topic. Make sure to read Example 21-3.*

**2.6.7 Expected Values of Some Common Distributions** <span
id="2.6.7"></span> 
*Note: The reading and lecture assigned below subunit 2.6 cover this
topic. Note that the* p *used in the formulas stands for the probability
of a successful outcome. For example, suppose that you are analyzing
whether or not customers will buy your product and have these two
possible outcomes: yes = successful outcome = the customer will buy and
no = not successful = the customer will not buy. If the probability that
someone will buy is 0.45; therefore, p = 0.45, and (1-p) = 0.55, which
is the probability that someone will not buy.*
