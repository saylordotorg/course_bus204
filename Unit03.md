**Unit 3: The Normal Distribution** <span id="3"></span> 
*A distribution is a line graph representation of the probability that
an event will occur.  It is similar to a histogram, but in a
distribution, the user does not determine the grouping; instead, data is
grouped according to the likelihood that it will occur within the
dataset.  Distributions also allow for analysis of a specific event,
whereas a histogram requires events be grouped.*  
    
 *An important type of this distribution is the* “*normal*”
*distribution. The* normal distribution*is used to approximate
real-world occurrences. If you can make certain assumptions about the
occurrence of an event, then you can use the normal distribution to find
out the probabilities of that event occurring. Many of the events that
are important to business can be approximated using the normal
distribution.*

    versions) include a tab entitled “Starter File,” which contains
    everything you need to get started on the activity.  Once you have
    worked through the activity, you can click on the “Solution File”
    tab to see how your finished spreadsheet should look.
