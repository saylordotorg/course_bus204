**Unit 1: Introduction to Statistical Analysis** <span id="1"></span> 
*Statistics may appear to be a difficult, even scary, subject. You will
find, however, that you are already familiar with the fundamentals
of statistics from your life experience. For instance, from your
experience, you know that the majority of adult males have the same shoe
size, which is very close to the average size, and that there are a few
adult males on both sides of the average (small and large size). In
statistics, this phenomenon shown from the data pattern is said to be a
variable that follows a* normal distribution*.*  
  
 *This unit will provide an introduction to statistical analysis and how
it relates to business. For example, you may be interested in learning
about the average price of a 50-inch digital TV by gathering the price
for it from 30 different stores. You take your 30 prices and compute the
average price. Given the fact that there are thousands of stores that
are selling that particular product, the next question in statistics is:
Are you confident enough to say that your computed average is reflective
of the real average that would be computing from all the existing prices
for that TV sold at all stores?*  
  
 *You are probably familiar with the average of a data set. In this
course, we will refer to what most people call the average as the*
arithmetic mean*. The average is actually any single value used to
describe the middle of a data set. The most common averages used in
statistics are the arithmetic mean, the median, and the mode. Each
describes the middle of a dataset in different ways. For example, the
median is the numeric value that separates the upper and lower half of a
data set. The mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of
values. The mode is the most common value within the dataset.*  
  
 *In many instances, the median and the mean are similar, but this
introductory unit will also identify many examples where it is not. The
distinction between summary statistics is important in business
statistics. This unit will define various terms that you may not be
familiar with, such as* variance *and* outliers*. Understanding this
vocabulary will be vital to the successful completion of this course.*

     Watching these lectures and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.

**1.2.1 Types of Variables: Quantitative vs. Qualitative** <span
id="1.2.1"></span> 
*Note: The material beneath subunit 1.2 covers this topic. For the
reading material, focus on the text below the heading “Variable.”
Carefully review the box labeled “Examples of Quantitative, Qualitative,
and Categorical Variables.” Make sure that you understand the
differences between* quantitative data*, which deals with numeric
information, and* qualitative data*, which measures categories or
characteristics.*

**1.2.2 Sample Data Sets** <span id="1.2.2"></span> 
*Note: The material beneath subunit 1.2 covers this topic. Note that a*
sample *is a portion of a population under interest. For example,
suppose that you are interested in computing the average age of a
manufacturing plant in the United States. Knowing that there are
thousands of manufacturing plants, you are more likely to choose for
your analysis just a sample, of say 200 manufacturing plants, from the
entire population. In the text below the heading “Sample Data Sets,” pay
special attention to the data set given in Table 3-3. This dataset will
be used throughout the rest of that chapter.*

**1.2.3 Frequency Tables** <span id="1.2.3"></span> 
*Note: The material beneath subunit 1.2 covers this topic. Review the
dataset in Table 3-3 in the text and the frequency table that follows
the table as these tables show you how to put numerical data into a
frequency table with the use of class intervals from the data.*

**1.2.4 Histograms** <span id="1.2.4"></span> 
*Note: The material beneath subunit 1.2 covers this topic. Be aware that
a histogram is a graph that uses the information from a frequency
table.*

**1.2.5 Skewness and Modes** <span id="1.2.5"></span> 
*Note: The material beneath subunit 1.2 covers this topic. As explained
in the text below the heading “Skewness and Modes,” a histogram of
incomes of individuals or home prices tends to be skewed to the right.*
Skewness *is a measure that shows whether the distribution of a variable
is symmetric.*

**1.2.6 Percentiles and Quartiles** <span id="1.2.6"></span> 
*Note: The material beneath subunit 1.2 covers this topic. Note that*
percentiles *are about cutting the histogram into 100 equal pieces.*
Quartiles *are about cutting the histogram into 4 equal parts.*

**1.2.7 Estimating Percentiles from Histograms** <span
id="1.2.7"></span> 
*Note: The material beneath subunit 1.2 covers this topic. You should
first consider how the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile is created by just
cutting the histogram into two equal parts. Be sure to do the online
exercises as shown below the heading “Estimating Percentiles from
Histograms.”*

     Instructions: Read this chapter, which will show you all the
    necessary formulas for computing descriptive statistics for
    analyzing data from a sample such as the mean, median, mode,
    variance, range, and standard deviation. There are several exercises
    and Java applets embedded in the text that are meant to further
    reinforce your learning. *Do not skip these exercises!* For
    instructions on how to navigate these exercises, see “Special
    Instructions on SticiGui Exercises and Java applets” in the course
    information section. This resource covers the topics outlined in

    difference between the variance of a population and that of a
    sample. Secondly, the “Sample Variance” lecture explains how to
    estimate the variance of a population using the variance of a
    sample. Finally, the “Standard Deviation” lecture provides a review
    for what you have learned so far as well as an introduction to
    standard deviation. These lectures also cover the topics outlined in
    subunits 1.3.1 through 1.3.4.

**1.3.1 Mean** <span id="1.3.1"></span> 
*Note: The material beneath subunit 1.3 covers this topic. As explained
in Chapter 4, the* mean *applies to numerical data and not to a
categorical variable, which does not have numbers.*

**1.3.2 Median** <span id="1.3.2"></span> 
*Note: The material beneath subunit 1.3 covers this topic. As explained
in Chapter 4, the* median *applies to numerical data and not to a

**1.3.3 Mode** <span id="1.3.3"></span> 
*Note: The material beneath subunit 1.3 covers this topic. As explained
in Chapter 4, the* mode *applies to both numerical and categorical
variables as it corresponds to the most frequent value.*

**1.3.4 Spread and Variability** <span id="1.3.4"></span> 
*Note: The material beneath subunit 1.3 covers this topic. Make sure to
watch the videos from the Khan Academy to learn how to compute the
variance and the standard deviation in detail.*

**1.3.5 Affine Transformations** <span id="1.3.5"></span> 
*Note: The material beneath subunit 1.3 covers this topic. Of concern is
the definition of an* affine transformation*: those variables that are
created from other variables through a direct relationship. An example
is converting the temperature from Centigrade to Fahrenheit degrees.*

**1.3.6 Markov’s Inequality** <span id="1.3.6"></span> 
*Note: The material beneath subunit 1.3 covers this topic. The best way
to learn about this topic is to follow Example 4-4 in order to see the
practicality of this concept.*

**1.3.7 Chebyshev’s Inequality for Lists** <span id="1.3.7"></span> 
*Note: The material beneath subunit 1.3 covers this topic. Be sure to
read Examples 4-5 and 4-6 as they show you, through examples, how
Markov’s inequality and Chebyshev’s inequality differ from each other.*
