Course Syllabus for "BUS204: Business Statistics"
-------------------------------------------------

This course will introduce you to business statistics, or the
application of statistics in the workplace. Statistics is a course in
the methods for gathering, analyzing, and interpreting data. If you have
taken a statistics course in the past, you may find some of the topics
in this course familiar. You can apply statistics to any number of
fields – from anthropology to hedge fund management – because many of us
best interpret data when it is presented in an organized fashion (as it
is with statistics). You can analyze data in any number of
forms. Summary statistics, for example, provide an overview of a data
set, such as the average score on an exam. However, the average does not
always tell the entire story; for example, if the average score is 80,
it may be because half of the students received 100s and the other half
received 60s. This would present a much different story than if everyone
in the class had received an 80, which demonstrates consistency.
Statistics provides more than simple averages. In this course, you will
learn how to apply statistical tools to analyze data, draw conclusions,
and make predictions of the future. The course will begin with data
distributions, followed by probability analysis, sampling, hypothesis
testing, inferential statistics, and, finally, regression. This course
is mathematically intensive, and much of what you learn here will deal
with things you encounter every day. This course also makes use of
spreadsheets, an important tool for working with and making sense of
numerical data. **This course provides students the opportunity to earn
actual college credit. It has been reviewed and recommended for 3 credit
hours by [The National College Credit Recommendation
Service](http://www.nationalccrs.org/) (NCCRS). While credit is not
guaranteed at all schools, we have
[partnered](http://www.saylor.org/partner-schools/) with a number of
schools who have expressed their willingness to accept transfer of
credits earned through Saylor. You can read more about our NCCRS program
[here](http://www.saylor.org/student-credit-pathways/nccrs/).**

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:  

-   explain the importance of statistics to business;
-   explain the differences between quantitative and qualitative data,
    and identify examples of each type of data;
-   define and apply the following terms: data sets, mean, median, mode,
    standard deviation, and variance;
-   summarize and interpret data in a tabular format using frequency
    distributions and visually with histograms;
-   define and apply the concept of a probability distribution, and
    explain the properties of different distributions;
-   differentiate between discrete and continuous probability
    distributions;
-   define and apply the concept of a random variable, and differentiate
    the population from a sample;
-   relate the central limit theorem to sample size and normal
    distribution;
-   describe and identify the different sampling methods, including
    systematic, stratified random, cluster, convenience, panel, and
    quota sampling, and identify examples of each;
-   use a point estimator from a sample to estimate the entire
    population;
-   estimate intervals over which the population parameter could
    exist using sample data;
-   apply hypothesis testing for testing population parameters using one
    or two samples;
-   identify the dependent and independent variables in the linear
    regression model;
-   plot a regression line, and explain how the regression coefficient
    shapes that line; and
-   work with statistical data in a spreadsheet environment.

Review of semester

*Note: There are no lectures for chapters 15, 16, 29, and 30. *

  
 **Special Instructions on *****SticiGui***** exercises and Java
applets:** Every chapter in the online textbook has exercises to check
your understanding; you should carefully work through each exercise. The
author of the text has provided instructions on how to work with the
exercises here: *SticiGui: *[“How to Use These
Materials.”](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/Text/howto.htm#how_to_use)\*  
    
 Embedded throughout the text are the *SticiGui* Java applets. Think of
these applets as little software programs that you can use to explore
the different aspects of statistics you are learning. Each Java applet
has instructions posted next to it in the text. You can find a listing
of all the *SticiGui* Java
applets [here](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Java/Html/index.htm);\*
follow the links to each applet for further description and instructions
on how to use each one. These applets should be compatible will all
major browsers; Java needs to be enabled in order for them to work.   
    
 The minimum system requirements for using these tools [are detailed
here](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/minimum.htm).\*  
  
 **Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. A
key point to remember is that to get the most out of this course, you
will need to complete each assignment and be sure you understand it!
Many of the units build on each other, so you will want to complete the
course in order.  
  
 Note that not all of the listed readings and lectures are required for
this course. Those that are not required are listed as optional. If you
would like to experience the full course as it was presented at
University of California, Berkeley, then you will want to go through
these optional sections as well. Note that anything considered optional
will not be on the Final Exam.  
  
 Besides reviewing these materials, you will also need to complete: 

-   The interactive examples included in the online textbook
    (*SticiGui *Exercises and Java applets)
-   The assessments at the end of each unit
-   The spreadsheet activities at the end of Units 1, 3, and 6
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final
exam. However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will
need to work through all required course materials and the assignments
listed above.  
  
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** Completing this course should take you a total
of **122.25 hours**. Note that there are some resources that are
indicated as optional. These resources total an additional 24.25
hours. Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the amount of time
you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should help you plan
your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at these time
advisories, to determine how much time you have over the next few weeks
to complete each unit, and then to set goals for yourself. For example,
Unit 1 should take you 13.75 hours. Perhaps you can sit down with your
calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1 and subunit 1.2 (total of
4.75 hours) on Monday and Tuesday nights; subunit 1.3 (about 4.5 hours)
on Wednesday and Thursday nights; etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** This course uses a complete online textbook,
developed by Dr. Philip Stark at the University of California, Berkeley.
This textbook is used in Dr. Stark’s Business Statistics course. This
textbook includes several interactive examples that you can use to
enhance your learning. Do not skip these examples! Learn how they work
and try to understand them. Many times, Dr. Stark will use these
examples in the online video lectures, so be sure to watch for them and
work the examples as he works them in class. You can read what the
author of the materials has to say about the best way to use these
materials by reviewing the material in the
[Preface](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/Text/index.htm).\*  
    
 Make sure to also take notes as you navigate through the resources in
this course. These notes will be useful to study from as you prepare to
take your final exam.  
  
 Use of a calculator is also permitted throughout the course and on the
final exam. The following online calculator in particular has been
authorized for use for proctored exams:

    Calculator](http://easycalculation.com/embedded_basic-scientific-calculator.php) (HTML).
