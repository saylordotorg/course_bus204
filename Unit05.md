**Unit 5: Estimation and Hypothesis Testing** <span id="5"></span> 
*Estimation is the process of making predictions based on the best
available information.  Businesses employ estimation in order to help
managers make decisions regarding the future.  For example, if the CFO
estimates profits will be lower next year, the CEO will consider
cost-cutting measures to make up for the loss.  Normally, companies do
not want to pursue aggressive cost-cutting because it usually comes in
the form of layoffs, which are bad for employee morale.*  
  
 *In order to make accurate estimates, companies use hypothesis
testing.  For example, assume the CFO thinks profits will be below 5% of
revenue next year.  His null hypothesis is that profits will be 5% or
greater next year.  The alternative hypothesis is that profits will not
be 5% or greater next year.  This seems counterintuitive but statistics
proposes that a hypothesis cannot be proven true; it can only be
rejected, or shown to be not true.  Through the hypothesis testing
process, the CFO will either reject or accept the null hypothesis. 
Hypothesis tests are always framed in this manner because, with
imperfect information, nothing can be proven. *  
    
 *Note: * *The best non-business analogy to hypothesis testing comes
from the courtroom. In the United States, a defendant is presumed
innocent until proven guilty. The null hypothesis in this scenario is*
innocent *or* not guilty*. The alternative hypothesis is* guilty*. In
order to find the defendant guilty, the jury must be offered enough
evidence that suggests the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt. If the members of the jury make that decision, then they reject
the null hypothesis. If the jury members decide they do not have enough
evidence to make that judgment, then they must find the defendant not
guilty. Notice* not guilty *does not mean the jury claims the defendant
is innocent. The decision simply means the members of the jury do not
have enough information to find the person guilty, so they err on the
side of caution and fail to reject the null hypothesis. As an aside, in
this example, beyond a reasonable doubt is analogous to the* level of
significance, *which you will learn is crucial to hypothesis testing.*

**5.3.1 Examples of Hypothesis Testing Problems** <span
id="5.3.1"></span> 
*Note: The reading and lectures assigned below subunit 5.3 cover this
topic. Before covering this section from Chapter 27 under the section
titled “Examples of Hypothesis Testing Problem,” make sure to read the
first section about hypothesis testing.  Hypothesis testing is the
scientific procedure needed when testing data from a sample and when
experiments are conducted to test their significance.*

**5.3.2 Significance Level and Power** <span id="5.3.2"></span> 
*Note: The reading and lectures assigned below subunit 5.3 cover this
topic. In statistics, the significance level refers to the probability
of concluding that the sample data give valid approximations for the
real population parameters when in fact that is not true.  The key is to
choose a small significance level.  This level is chosen by the data
analyst but the most common one is the 0.05 significance level, which
translates to using a 95% confidence level.*

**5.3.3 Test Statistics and P-values** <span id="5.3.3"></span> 
*Note: The reading and lectures assigned below subunit 5.3 cover this
topic. Make sure to read Examples 27-2 and 27-3.  Also, watch the video
from the Khan Academy “Hypothesis Testing and P-values” as it shows you
how to test a hypothesis.*

**5.3.4 Hypotheses about Parameters** <span id="5.3.4"></span> 
*Note: The reading and lectures assigned below subunit 5.3 cover this
topic. In Chapter 27 under the section titled “Hypotheses about
Parameters,” pay special attention to the concepts: rejection region,
one-sided, and two-sided tests.  Also, make sure to read the case study
titled “Case Study: Employment Discrimination Arbitration” in order to
understand how hypothesis testing is done in practice.*

**5.3.5 Population Parameters Testing Using One or Two Samples** <span
id="5.3.5"></span> 
*Note: The reading and lectures assigned below subunit 5.3 cover this
topic. In addition to reading Chapter 27 from the main text, read the
sections titled* *“10 Hypothesis Testing” and “11 Testing the Two Sample
Means with the t-Test” in the reading from the College of
Micronesia-FSM: Dana Lee Ling's* Introduction to Statistics Using
OpenOffice.org.* Those sources will reinforce your understanding of the
difference in hypothesis testing between one and two samples.*

**5.3.6 Caveats: The Meaning of Rejection, Statistical Significance and
Practical Importance, and Interpreting P-values** <span
id="5.3.6"></span> 
*Note: The reading and lectures assigned below subunit 5.3 cover this
topic. In Chapter 27 from the main text, make sure to read the final
section titled “Caveats,” which explains the most common problems one
makes when conducting hypothesis testing.*

    low income women versus the percent of high income women that belong
    to one sample. Then, you want to compare those percentages to a
    different but similar sample of women. There are several exercises
